          The Reefer Madness movie poster focuses on the adult desire
          for drugs. A woman on the bottom left hangs from a burning cigarette. Her 
          eyes are hollowed out. A man on the top right shares her zombie-like state, with
          a cigarette in his mouth and the look of delirium in his eyes.

          In the top half of the poster, a man is calmly injecting a needle
          in a woman's arm. She wears a loose dress, revealing most of her chest. 
          Her image is titled with 'Shame, Horror, Despair', written next to her figure. 
          In the bottom half of the poster, a woman stares at the devil's hand, where each finger touches 
          a cigarette with a word of shame written on it (e.g. Lust, Crime, Sorrow).

          A woman, with a cigarette in between her lips, looks lustfully 
          at the devil. He smiles cunningly at the viewer. The words 'Sin, Degradation,
          Vice, Insanity' decorate his body. A cigarette horizontally splits the poster, the smoke 
          is filled with the bold text: 'A Vicious Racket With It's Arms Around Your Children!'

          In the top left, a man is behind bars and looks longingly at the viewer. In the top right, a couple,
          with the same man in jail on the left, is dressed stylishly and sits calmly. The woman slyly looks at the man
          while he stares off, disillusioned, into the distance.  On a bottom, a woman has fallen and tries to climb
          back up by holding onto the large, centered bubble text 'Cocaine'.

          A blue circle is in the center of the poster. There is a woman in this blue tunnel, with only half her face
          visible behind the large red title text 'The Marihuana Story'. Only her right eye and large red lips, with a cigarette
          between them, are visible. Above this window, there is a cut out of newspaper titled 'Sensational ExposÃ© About Public Enemy No.1'.
